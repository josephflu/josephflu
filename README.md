# Hey, I'm Joseph 👋

**Principal Software Engineer** building AI systems that ship.

I turn prototypes into production — especially the boring reliability work that makes autonomous systems actually work. Currently deep into multi-agent orchestration, RAG pipelines, and developer tooling.

## What I'm Working On

🤖 **Agentic AI** — Multi-agent frameworks that go from ticket to PR autonomously
🔧 **Developer Tools** — CLI utilities, CI/CD pipelines, container orchestration
📊 **Data Platforms** — RAG systems, vector search, enterprise data infrastructure

## Career Highlights

**Kizen** — Principal Backend Engineer
- Architected multi-agent orchestration framework (planning → code gen → testing → review) generating ~1,000 lines/day with structured human review gates
- Built RAG pipelines in Django with pgvector similarity search and LLM-driven query processing
- Wrote a production web crawler for document ingestion and vector embeddings

**Salesforce** — Principal / Lead Software Engineer
- Containerized Tableau Bridge from Windows Service to Docker/Linux/Kubernetes
- Published [`langchain-tableau`](https://pypi.org/project/langchain-tableau/) — pip package for Tableau agentic workflows
- Built [BridgeCTL](https://github.com/Tab-SE/BridgeCTL) — CLI for Tableau Bridge containers (12K+ lines Python, 1,500+ downloads)
- Designed HammerHead CI/CD pipeline adopted by 45 teams, 1,000+ engineers, spinning up 200K+ AWS EC2 instances
- Reduced AWS spending by >$20K/month in the first month

**Thermo Fisher Scientific** — Lead Software Architect
